## Command explanation

### `ffmpeg`
Framework that decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created. Read the official documentation [here](https://ffmpeg.org/about.html).

### `-i assets/video.mp4`
Set the input as our video.

### ` fps=1/10`
